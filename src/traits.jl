    ParentLinks(::Type{T})
    ParentLinks(tree)

A trait which indicates whether a tree node stores references to its parents (`StoredParents()`) or
if the parents must be inferred from the tree structure (`ImplicitParents()`).

Trees for which `parentlinks` returns `StoredParents()` *MUST* implement [`parent`](@ref).

If `StoredParents()`, all nodes in the tree must also have `StoredParents()`, otherwise use
`ImplicitParents()`.

**OPTIONAL**: This should be implemented for a tree if parents of nodes are stored
```julia
AbstractTrees.parentlinks(::Type{<:TreeType}) = AbstractTrees.StoredParents()
parent(t::TreeType) = get_parent(t)
```
"""
abstract type ParentLinks end

"""
    StoredParents <: ParentLinks

Indicates that this node stores parent links explicitly. The implementation
is responsible for defining the parentind function to expose this
information.

If a node in a tree has this trait, so must all connected nodes.  If this is not the case,
use [`ImplicitParents`](@ref) instead.

## Required Methods
- [`parent`](@ref)

    SiblingLinks(::Type{T})
    SiblingLinks(tree)

A trait which indicates whether a tree node stores references to its siblings (`StoredSiblings()`) or
must be inferred from the tree structure (`ImplicitSiblings()`).

If a node has the trait `StoredSiblings()`, so must all connected nodes in the tree.  Otherwise,
use `ImplicitSiblings()` instead.

    StoredSiblings <: SiblingLinks

Indicates that this tree node stores sibling links explicitly, or can compute them
quickly (e.g. because the tree has a (small) fixed branching ratio, so the
current index of a node can be determined by quick linear search).

If a node has this trait, so must all connected nodes in the tree.  Otherwise, use `ImplicitSiblings()` instead.

A trait indicating whether the tree node `n` has children (as returned by [`children`](@ref)) which can be
indexed using 1-based indexing.

`NonIndexedChildren()` instead.

Options are either [`NonIndexedChildren`](@ref) (default) or [`IndexedChildren`](@ref).

Indicates that the object returned by `children(n)` where `n` is a tree node is indexable (1-based).

## Required Methods
- A node `node` with this trait must return an indexable object from `children(node)`.

Indicates the type of the children (the *collection* of children, not individual children) of the tree node `n`

If the `childrentype` can be inferred from the type of the node alone, the type `::Type{T}` definition is preferred
(the latter will fall back to it).

**OPTIONAL**: It is strongly recommended to define this wherever possible, as without it almost no tree algorithms
can be type-stable.  If `childrentype` is defined and can be known from the node type alone, this function will
fall back to `eltype(childrentype(T))`.  If this gives a correct result it's not necessary to define `childtype`.

traversal is type stable.
